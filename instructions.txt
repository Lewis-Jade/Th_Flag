 🌟 Cyb3rs3c Fr4t4nity CTF Challenge 🌟

Welcome, hacker! 🏴‍☠️ Your mission is simple: Find the hidden flag.
But remember,  coffee is never free! ☕😏

---

🛠️ Step 1: Setup the Challenge
First, make sure you can execute the setup script. Run this command:

 
chmod +x setup.sh


Then, execute it to set up your environment:

bash
./setup.sh

This will create a **hidden directory** somewhere... but can you find it? 😈  

---

🕵️ Step 2: Start the Hunt
Now, use your Linux skills  to uncover the secrets. Some useful commands:  

- Check hidden files & directories:

  ls -la
  

Navigate like a ghost: 
  
  cd <directory_name>
  

Peek inside files:
  cat <file_name>
  


🤔 Hint:
 "You owe me a cup of coffee, but where’s my sugar?"_ ☕🍬  

Can you find the sweet reward**, or will you be left  bitter and flagless? 😆  

---

🚀 Good luck, and remember: No flags for lazy minds! 💀🔥  

===============================================================
NOTE:
     "Ukitaka kujua coffee si free,uliza Lewis!" ☕😆
      Na ukiona wasee wakianza kukuchunguza kama Linux professor, jua mission accomplished 🚀😂
